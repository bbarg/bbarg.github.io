My partner and I recently moved to Somerville and we're building a list of good music
venues. It's nice to have a ready-made list to check when we want to see music in a
particular week.

Here are some that we like:

- [The Burren](http://www.burren.com/music.html)
- [Arts at the Armory](https://artsatthearmory.org/)
- [The Jungle Community Music Club](https://www.thejunglemusicclub.com/events-calendar)
- [The Sinclair](https://www.sinclaircambridge.com/)
- [The Lilypad](https://www.lilypadinman.com/calendar)
- [The Druid](https://www.druidpub.com/music)
